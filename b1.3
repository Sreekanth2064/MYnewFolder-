 HEAD
i will like to modifie this file , and i have used vi to open it directly in git working space 
what ever the results i get i will add this file to branch b1 

i want to add this file, and meger it to master branch, there after i will push this inside my remote repository 
in git hub
and now  i commited this file to master branch and push it to remote server 
and i saw a merge conflict there so i had to pull the files back again and ediited it , now i will commit this file to b1 branch where it belongs
but when i tried to change the branch from b2 to b1  it shows me first i have to resolve this conflict so i will push this file to stash.
